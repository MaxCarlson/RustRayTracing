# Just A Small Foray into Rust

First project in Rust - tried to follow along to a C++ guide to making a raytracer, but used Rust instead to learn a bit about it. 
Here's an example output image from a compiled scene, a few materials and reflective properties 
- Metals, Glass, Matte surfaces. Using Metal, Lambertian (matte), Dielectric (glass) scatter/shader models.
